### [CNC Mill Tool Wear](https://www.kaggle.com/shasun/tool-wear-detection-in-cnc-mill/data) 

CNC Mill Tool Wear data was provided to perform classification studies such as 'Tool wear detection' and 'Detection of inadequate clamping'.     

A series of machining experiments were run on 2" x 2" x 1.5" wax blocks in a CNC milling machine in the System-level Manufacturing and Automation Research Testbed (SMART) at the University of Michigan. Machining data was collected from a CNC machine for variations of tool condition, feed rate, and clamping pressure. Each experiment produced a finished wax part with an "S" shape - S for smart manufacturing - carved into the top face, as shown in `test_artifact.jpg` (included in the dataset).  

General data from each of the 18 different experiments are given in `train.csv`  Time series data was collected from the 18 experiments with a sampling rate of `100 ms` and are separately reported in files `experiment_01.csv` to `experiment_18.csv`. Each `experiment_xx.csv` file consists of 48 columns and the number of each row is from `experiment_01.csv` to `experiment_18.csv` (1056, 1669, 1522, 533, 463, 1297, 566, 606, 741, 1302, 2315, 2276 , 2234, 2333, 1382, 603, 2151, 2254). Time series data from 18 experiments is collected at a sampling rate of 100 ms.

- Two ways to use CNC measurements   

  (1) Taking every CNC measurement as an independent observation where the operation being performed is given in the Machining_Process column. Active machining operations are labeled as "Layer 1 Up", "Layer 1 Down", "Layer 2 Up", "Layer 2 Down", "Layer 3 Up", and "Layer 3 Down".    

  (2) Taking each one of the 18 experiments (the entire time series) as an observation for time series classification

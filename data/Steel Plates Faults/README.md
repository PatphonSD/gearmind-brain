| Number of Instances | Number of Attributes |      |      |

A dataset of steel platesâ€™ faults, classified into 7 different types. The goal was to train machine learning for automatic pattern recognition.

Dataset has 7 binary features that describe the 27 features describing fault(location, size,...) and type of fault(one of 7: Pastry, Z_Scratch, K_Scatch, Stains, Dirtiness, Bumps, Other_Faults). The type part of t he fault is also used as a binary classification target('common' or 'other' fault).

The last 7 columns are one hot encoded classes, i.e. if the plate fault is classified as "Stains" there will be a 1 in that column and 0's in the other columns. If you are unfamiliar with one hot encoding, just know that the last seven columns are your class labels.

All dataset records indicate a superficial fault of stainless steel leaf. There are six types of faults: The fault description consists of 27 indicators that indicate the geometry of the fault and its outline.
